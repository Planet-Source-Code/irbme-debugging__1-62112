## Debugging


</div>

### Description

Every day I have to help people fix their code. I'm amazed every time at how easy the bugs usually are to find, and always learn that the person didn't even make an attempt at debugging their code, because they simply don't know how. So I wrote up this quick pdf file to try to explain some of the key debugging techniques to all the newbies out there.
